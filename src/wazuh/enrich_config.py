        As opposed to when searching for network traffic :term:`SCOs <SCO>`,
        enrichment will only extract network traffic from fields known to
        contain network traffic logs. Searching is perfomed much more broadly.
        Therefore, there is (currently) no support for domain names and MAC

        At least two of src_ref, dst_ref, src_port and dst_port must be
        present for the SCO to be created. protocols may be inferred from the
        event.

        .. note:: Unfortunately, OpenCTI has decided to focus on dst_port when
                  displaying the network traffic SCO in graphs, or "Unknown"
                  if the dst_port is not set. In many alerts, the destination
                  port is not known. In order to provide a more helpful way to
                  understand the SCO, the connector writes a connetion string
                  in the description, like "ipv4:ssh 10.20.30.40 â†’

        be populated (even if there is a lot of other useful information). The

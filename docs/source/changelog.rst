Roadmap
~~~~~~~

See the project's :github:`issues <issues>` and :github:`milestones
<milestones>` pages on GitHub for up-to-date information.

Full indicator support
----------------------

The next release is planned to feature support for looking up indicators
directly using their STIX patterns (:github:`issue #9 <issues/9>`).

Streaming alerts to OpenCTI
---------------------------

Expanding on `wazuh-opencti <https://github.com/misje/wazuh-opencti>`_, and
filling the obvious missing piece of looking up *new* alerts in OpenCTI,
opencti-wazuh-connector should in the future implement a stream connector doing
exactly this.

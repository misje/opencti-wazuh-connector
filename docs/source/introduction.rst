If you're very familiar with both Wazuh and OpenCTI, feel free to skip to
:ref:`architecture <architecture>` to read about the connector, or if you're
impatient, skip to :ref:`installation <installation>`. If you're very, very
impatient, have a look at :ref:`quick start <quick-start>`.

If you're showing interest in this connector, it's assumed that you're already
a Wazuh user. After all, the conector has little to no use unless you have
Wazuh deployed. Installing, configuring and using Wazuh is very much out of
scope of this documentation, as it focuses on OpenCTI.

Even if you're a Wazuh user, take a look at the :ref:`Wazuh <wazuh>` chapter to
ensure that you're familiar with the core concepts.

Next, look at the :ref:`OpenCTI <opencti>` chapter and then the :ref:`connector
architecture <architecture>`.

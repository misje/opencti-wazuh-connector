If you are very familiar with both Wazuh and OpenCTI, feel free to skip to
:ref:`architecture <architecture>` to read about the connector, or if you are
impatient, skip to :ref:`installation <installation>`. If you are very, very
impatient, have a look at :ref:`quick start <quick-start>`.

If you are showing interest in this connector, it is assumed that you are
already a Wazuh user. After all, the connector has little to no use unless you
have Wazuh deployed. Installing, configuring and using Wazuh is very much out
of scope of this documentation, as it focuses on OpenCTI.

Even if you are a Wazuh user, take a look at the :ref:`Wazuh <wazuh>` chapter
to ensure that you are familiar with the core concepts.

Next, look at the :ref:`OpenCTI <opencti>` chapter and then the :ref:`connector
architecture <architecture>`.
